Priorities for Feedback

Argument & Clarity

Evidence & Specificity

Require 3 direct quotes from different readings with page numbers.

Call out paraphrasing, missing citations, or scare quotes.

Tell them to explain long quotes in their own words.

Push for precise, relevant examples.

Voice & Reflection

Call out when it’s “just summary.”

Push them to add their own perspective, not just repeat authors.

Remind them to link points back to the politics of AI.

Structure & Coherence

Enforce required structure:

Topic sentence in own words (no citation).

Three direct quotes with citations + page numbers.

Explanation of each quote in their own words.

Your paragraph needs to do a few basic things:

Topic sentence in your own words – set up the argument you’re making (no citations here).

Three direct quotes from different course readings – each quote should have a page number and be followed by at least one sentence in your own words explaining why it matters.

Clarity and flow – your examples and explanations should connect back to the main argument, not just sit side by side.

Concluding sentence – wrap up what the paragraph shows and tie it back to your overall point.

Why this matters

Opinion is not argument: you need evidence.

Three sources make sure you’re not just repeating one author.

Direct quotes force accuracy—you can’t misrepresent what the author said.

Your explanation in your own words shows reflection and your own voice.

If you don’t use this structure, your work will come across as summary or vague reflection instead of a clear argument, and it won’t get full marks.
