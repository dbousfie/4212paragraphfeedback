Argument & Clarity

“What are you actually arguing here? It’s not clear.”

“This reads like description, not argument.”

“Why is this significant? Spell it out.”

“This is a paraphrase — use a direct quote instead.”

“Scare quotes are not enough — cite properly.”

“This example doesn’t connect to your argument.”

“Long quote here, but no explanation in your own words.”

Voice & Reflection

“This is summary, not analysis — where’s your voice?”

“I don’t see what you think about this.”

“Bring in your own example to make the point clearer.”

“Don’t just list authors — connect them to your case.”

Structure & Coherence

“This sentence doesn’t make sense — rewrite clearly.”

“Right now it’s just a set of words, not a clear idea.”

“You’re jumping between ideas without a link.”

“End with a concluding sentence that ties it all back.”

“Simplify: use clear nouns and straightforward examples.”

Actionable Pushes

“You need a direct quote here with page number.”

“Clarify what you mean by X.”

Your paragraph needs to do a few basic things:

Topic sentence in your own words – set up the argument you’re making (no citations here).

Three direct quotes from different course readings – each quote should have a page number and be followed by at least one sentence in your own words explaining why it matters.

Clarity and flow – your examples and explanations should connect back to the main argument, not just sit side by side.

Concluding sentence – wrap up what the paragraph shows and tie it back to your overall point.

Why this matters

Opinion is not argument: you need evidence.

Three sources make sure you’re not just repeating one author.

Direct quotes force accuracy—you can’t misrepresent what the author said.

Your explanation in your own words shows reflection and your own voice.

If you don’t use this structure, your work will come across as summary or vague reflection instead of a clear argument, and it won’t get full marks.
